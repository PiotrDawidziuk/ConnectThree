ConnectThree

A simple game made with the help of a fantastic Android Studio course  The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course - Build 23 Apps! by Rob Percieval that can be found on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-android-oreo-developer-course/

There was a problem concerning the Grid Layout, but it was resolved by using the correct import "import android.support.v7.widget.GridLayout;"

Have fun playing!
